# HentaiFoxData
This is the sourcecode of my Windows-Application HentaiFoxDesktop.

You can download the finished version on the releases tab.
It comes with a "compiled" (made using pyinstaller) "HFDesktop3.exe" which you can run without the need of a Python 3.8 installation and all the used libraries.

HentaiFox Desktop features:

1. A custom Browser tab made only for browsing hentaifox.com!
2. A multi-search tab where you can white- and blacklist tags, parodies, characters, artists, groups and categories. 
3. A Result Viewer tab where you can view the results from using the multisearch engine. You can also load .result files you got from other people by dropping them in the "results (JSON)" folder.
4. A update tab where you can update the local datamap. The datamap is used for the multisearch engine and contains information about every gallery on hentaifox. I recommend running it once a week. If you for some reason completly f-ed up the datamap, you can delete all the files in the tags, parodies, characters, aritsts, groups and categroies folder and set the slider in the updates tab to everything. I suggest using a VPN when doing that, because updating the datamap is a pretty rich webscraper.

If the programs crashes for seemingly no reason when using the browser, try deleting the cache folder found at C:\User\[user]\AppData\Local\HentaiFox
